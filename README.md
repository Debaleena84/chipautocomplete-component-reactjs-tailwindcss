Implementation
Set up Component on Initialization
Added basic structure of component ChipAutoComplete.
Initiated the inputValue, chips, and suggestions.
State Management and Input Change Handler
Added handleInputChange to manage input changes and filter suggestions according to the change in input.
Chip Creation on Enter Key
Added handleKeyDown to create a chip when the Enter key is hit without adding duplicates.
Chip Loading and Unloading
The chips were displayed, and they could be removed by clicking the cross icon.
Suggestions Dropdown and Click Handler
Used a drop-down to view suggestions and applied a click handler so that on the click of a suggestion, the same would be added as a chip.
Highlight Matching Text in Suggestions
Added getHighlightedText to highlight the substring of the suggestion that is matched by the input.
Keyboard Navigation
Added keyboard navigation to the suggestions list, made available via arrow keys.
Clear All Chips Button
Added a 'Clear All' button to allow the user to clear all the chips in one action.
